The run_analysis.R does the following step by step
1. read the features info into table
2. read both train and test datasets and appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
3. read activitiy labels into tables
4. merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
5. extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
6. use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
7. create a second tidy data set that consists of the mean value of each
   variable for each subject and activity pair and write into txt file "second_data_set_tidy.txt"
